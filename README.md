This task is about preparing our carriers for interviews on a new journey
We have created a code quiz using JavaScript basics to store high scores:
First I start  my Pseudocode and give the idea of wireframe:

Second, create HTML file and added Bootstrap, doing more research about how to use and get more information on:

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/

Start work with JavaScript,  Added the variables to be used and found the best way to accomplish it
I found a lot information online, some of them is:

Then My logic is to create a question and complete the rest of the requests for this evaluation:![Screenshot 2021-11-14 at 12 24 37 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91921941/141691521-c3a8058e-6644-4d3d-a227-43871ae319d8.png)

and create the algorithm for the assignment added time counted, storage high score, and added my "SECRET PLAYER"
